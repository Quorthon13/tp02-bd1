## Running the Application

To run the application, move to the source folder i.e. the folder contains 'package.json' file and execute `npm install`

The source folder also contains 'app.js' file. Execute `npx nodemon app.js` to run the application.

If everything goes well, you should see 'server started on port 4000'. Move to (http://localhost:4000/) in default browser.
